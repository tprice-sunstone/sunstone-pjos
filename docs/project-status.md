**Product:** Sunstone Studio — a vertical SaaS platform for permanent jewelry artists
**URL:** https://sunstonepj.app (live on Vercel)

**Founder:** Tony Price
**Stack:** Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + RLS), Tailwind CSS, Vercel

**What it does:** All-in-one business platform for permanent jewelry artists — POS, inventory management, client CRM, AI mentor (Sunny), event/queue management, digital waivers, gift cards, financial reporting, two-way SMS messaging, automated workflows, and integrated Stripe payments.

**Business model:**
- Subscription tiers: Starter ($99/mo), Pro ($169/mo), Business ($279/mo)

## 6. KEY BUSINESS RULES

- **Chain model:** Chain is raw material in inches. Customers see finished products (bracelet, anklet, etc.), never inch measurements.
- **Jump rings:** 1 per item, 2 for hand chains. Material matching by material_id.
- **Platform fee:** Deducted from artist's Stripe payout via application_fee_amount. Customer never sees a fee. Called "platform fee" internally, never "credit card fee" or "surcharge."
- **Payment recording:** "Charge Customer" = Stripe processes payment. "Record External Payment" = just bookkeeping, no charge processed.
- **Pending sales:** Sales created when payment link is generated have payment_status='pending'. They don't appear in reports and inventory isn't deducted until webhook confirms payment.
- **Sunny rules:** Only 3 Sunstone welders exist (Zapp, Zapp Plus 2, mPulse). Never hallucinate products. Answer only what was asked. 2-3 sentences by default. Brevity is respect.
- **CRM requires base plan:** Can't purchase CRM standalone after trial.

## 10. HOW TO START A NEW THREAD

Paste this at the beginning of a new Claude conversation:

"I'm Tony Price, founder of Sunstone Studio (sunstonepj.app). This is a vertical SaaS platform for permanent jewelry artists built with Next.js 15, TypeScript, Supabase, and deployed on Vercel. Please read the PROJECT_STATUS.md file in the project knowledge base for full context on what's built, what's in progress, and what's next. I use Claude Code for implementation — give me prompts to paste, not direct file edits."

---

## 11. WORKFLOW PATTERN

Tony's development workflow:
1. **Plan in Claude chat** (this conversation) — discuss strategy, make decisions
2. **Claude writes the prompt** — detailed, specific instructions for Claude Code
3. **Tony pastes prompt into Claude Code** (VS Code terminal) — Claude Code executes
4. **Tony reports results** — completion report, errors, screenshots
5. **Debug in Claude chat** — fix issues, iterate
6. **Push to Vercel** — git push triggers automatic deployment

Key rules:
- Always output complete Claude Code prompts, not raw code to paste into files
- Run `npm run build` before pushing to catch errors locally
- Run SQL migrations in Supabase SQL Editor manually
- Check Vercel logs for production-specific errors
- Fire-and-forget for non-critical operations (cost logging, analytics)
